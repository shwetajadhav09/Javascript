/*
Primitive datatypes

types->7 :
string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, BigInt

Reference datatypes (Non primitive)

array, objects, functions


javascript is a dynamically typed language which means datatypes of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime
and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them
